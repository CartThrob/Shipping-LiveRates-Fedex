If you are looking for support for EE3, try the [EE3 branch](https://github.com/CartThrob/Shipping-LiveRates-Fedex/tree/EE3).

**Requirements:**
* CartThrob 4+
* PHP 7.1+

**Directions:**
To implement live rates shipping plugins place them in your cartthrob folder in the following locations:  

Plugins:
_system/user/addons/cartthrob/third_party/shipping_plugins_

Language Files: 
_system/user/addons/cartthrob/third_party/shipping_plugins_

Also, please review the included sample template code, as well as the information on the following pages: 

https://cartthrob.com/docs/tags_detail/get_live_rates_form/index.html
https://cartthrob.com/docs/tags_detail/get_shipping_options/

These 2 pages explain how to use live rates plugins, and explain a little bit about using live rates in general. No matter what system you use any time you use dynamically generated rates gathered directly from a shipping company you will be required to provide large amounts of detail to those shippers in order to get accurate shipping quotes.

The included plugins can be used as a starting point for developing your own live rates systems tailored specifically to your customers specifications. Almost every implementation of an accurate live rates system requires customization to your clients specifications.

**Support:**
Please note, modifications and support for these plugins are not included in the standard CartThrob purchase. This plugin is provided as-is at no cost with no warranty expressed or implied. Support is not included.
