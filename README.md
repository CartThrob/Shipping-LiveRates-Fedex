## Code Quality

* Prior to committing, run `php-cs-fixer fix` to validate code formatting.

## Requirements
* CartThrob 6.2.1+
* PHP 7.4+

## Installation
Download the add-on and unzip its contents.

Upload the add-onâ€™s folder to your system/user/addons/ folder.

Once the add-on is uploaded, you should see it listed in the Add-on Manager in your ExpressionEngine Control Panel. You can then click install!

## Usage and Implementation
Once installed, the FedEx Live Rates Add-On will be available within the CartThrob -> Shipping settings screen.

Please review the included sample template code, as well as the information on the following pages: 
* https://cartthrob.com/docs/tags_detail/get_live_rates_form/index.html
* https://cartthrob.com/docs/tags_detail/get_shipping_options/

These 2 pages explain how to use live rates plugins, and explain a little bit about using live rates in general. No matter what system you use any time you use dynamically generated rates gathered directly from a shipping company you will be required to provide large amounts of detail to those shippers in order to get accurate shipping quotes.

The included plugins can be used as a starting point for developing your own live rates systems tailored specifically to your customers specifications. Almost every implementation of an accurate live rates system requires customization to your client's specifications.
